        Butter chicken, or murgh makhani, is a classic Indian dish made with tender chicken pieces cooked in a creamy, mildly spiced tomato sauce. The origins of butter chicken can be traced back to Delhi, India, where it was created by the chefs of the Moti Mahal restaurant in the 1950s. The dish was reportedly invented by chance when leftover tandoori chicken was cooked in a rich, buttery tomato gravy. Butter chicken is known for its rich, velvety texture and mild, buttery flavor. It is typically served with naan or rice and garnished with fresh cilantro. Butter chicken has become a popular dish worldwide and is a favorite in Indian restaurants around the globe.
