    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/iOfxQGOJTdM0K6edW-MFkn-nydE=/0x512/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/23600-worlds-best-lasagna-DDMFS-4x3-1196-24c5401652934ffb96d3d94bc9fbe2d7.jpg" alt="lasagna">
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian pasta dish made of wide, flat noodles layered with various fillings. The traditional version consists of several layers of lasagna noodles alternating with a meat sauce (usually a Bolognese ragù), béchamel sauce, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. These layers are typically baked until the pasta is tender and the top is golden brown and bubbling.

        The origins of lasagna can be traced back to ancient Rome, though the modern version we know today evolved in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, particularly in the city of Bologna. The name "lasagna" actually refers to the type of pasta used - those wide, flat noodles - rather than the completed dish itself.
        
        While the classic recipe remains popular, there are countless variations including:
        - Vegetarian versions with roasted vegetables and ricotta
        - White lasagna made without tomato sauce
        - Seafood lasagna
        - Spinach and mushroom lasagna
        
        The key to great lasagna is in the careful construction of its layers and allowing it to rest briefly after baking so the layers set and don't collapse when served. It's often considered a comfort food and is popular at family gatherings and special occasions.
